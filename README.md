### Prerequisites
- Ownership of a Zehnder ComfoConnect PRO interface and ComfoAir Q 350 series
- Network connection to the Zehnder ComfoConnect PRO interface (Modbus-TCP)

## Configuration via UI
When adding the component to the Home Assistant intance, the config dialog will ask for Name, Host/IP-Address and Slave ID of the interface and the port number (usually 502 for Modbus over TCP)

## Entities

The integration creates multiple entities for recieving that states of the ventilation and for controlling mode.

## Activating Modbus-TCP using Zehnder ComfoConnect PRO Webinterface
- Go to the default web page of your Zehnder ComfoConnect PRO. (Served on port 80 of Interface-IP address)
- Login as admin
- Press 'Protocols and Services'
- Select 3rd Party Protocols, choose 'ModBus TCP'
- Leave the default settings (Slave ID: 1, TCP Port: 502)
- Press "Save"
- Done (take a minute to reboot)

If you have setup the interface already the data should be getting in at this point
Disclaimer: Use at own risk. As admin user you can do quite some settings that should not be done if you do not know what you are doing. In other words: Don't change any settings unless you have been instructed to by a Zehnder expert as admin.
